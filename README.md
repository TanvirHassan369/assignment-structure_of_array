# Language Comparison: C++ vs JavaScript


---

## Memory Management

- **C++**:

  - Explicit control over memory allocation.
  - Stack storage (`int arr[5]`) â†’ fast access, automatic cleanup.
  - Heap storage (`new/delete`) â†’ dynamic sizing, manual management.
  - Risk of memory leaks if delete is missed.

- **JavaScript:**:
  - Fully automatic memory management.
  - All objects (including arrays) are heap-allocated.
  - Garbage collection automatically handles memory cleanup.
  - No manual memory control (no new/delete for arrays).

## Array Types

| Type                     | C++                                                          | JavaScript                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fixed Dynamic Arrays** | Stack-allocated (int arr[5]) or heap with new int[size].     | new Array(size); initial fixed length but resizable.                      |
| **Stack Dynamic Arrays** | Variable-Length Arrays (int arr[size]) (compiler-dependent). | Arrays inside function scope (let arr = []), cleared after function ends. |
| **Fixed Heap Arrays**    | new int[size], manually managed (delete[] arr).              | new Array(size), manually keep size unchanged.                            |
| **Heap Dynamic Arrays**  | std::vector, supports dynamic growth (push_back()).          | Arrays grow dynamically using push(), pop().                              |

## Key Takeaways

### Control vs Convenience

- **C++**: C++: Gives developers full control over memory (stack vs heap).
- **JavaScript**: Hides memory management details, focuses on easy usage.

### Memory Safety

- **C++**: C++: Manual memory management risks (like memory leaks).
- **JavaScript**: Garbage collector ensures memory is freed safely.

### Performance

- **C++**: Faster, especially in compute-heavy or memory-sensitive applications.
- **JavaScript**: Slower, but optimized for web apps and fast development.

### Design Philosophy

- **C++**: Trusts developers with control and responsibility.
- **JavaScript**: Prioritizes developer simplicity and rapid prototyping.
